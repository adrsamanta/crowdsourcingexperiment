1 screen tutorial (shouldn't need more than that, this is a pretty simple app)
    Route: /tutorial

Lobby screen for waiting until all participants are there
    /lobby

Too late screen for if participant arrived too late
    /late

Game screen that hold game
    display top X users as needed
    /game

App plan:
    have a collection of score objects, each tracking userid, username (if applicable) and user group (again, if applicable)
        if have user group, only sub to users in the user group
    every time user scores 1, update the value in the database (this is going to get really intense if we're expecting an update every ~3 seconds or so)

    ensure that stuff gets logged to another collection. Find out what exactly should be logged here
